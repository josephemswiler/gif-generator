# Gif Generator

Gif Generator uses the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/ "Giphy API Documentation") to display 10 gifs based on a search term. Several buttons are provided with suggested search terms to help you begin your gif generating journey! Additional buttons are added to the page after each search to easily display gifs obtained from a previous search term. The page has a 'lazy load' feature that gracefully provides your wonderful gifs one at a time. When the gifs are loaded, they are still images - click the gif to play and pause the gif animation!

Cheers!
